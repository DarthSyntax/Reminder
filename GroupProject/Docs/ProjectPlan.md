## 1 Introduction

`ReminderManager` is an Android app that will manage a user's list of reminders with date, time, and location based alerts. Users can add, edit, and remove reminders and reminder lists.

## 2 Process Description

`ShowReminderLists`  
This activity shows the default screen of the app; it shows all of the user's reminders organized by the user into lists. If the user hasn't created a reminder or a reminder list yet, then an empty, default list will be shown and the user will have the option to create reminders and reminder lists. All reminders and lists will be organized by reminder type and name, as specified by the user.  
**Entrance Criteria**: This is the first screen of the app so there is no entrance criteria in this case. If the user returns to this screen after making some change (to a reminder or a list through creation, modification, or deletion) then this screen will reflect those changes (the changes are the entrance criteria).  
**Exit Criteria**: This screen will show all of the user's reminders in lists organized by type and name. The activity will have been completed successfully if any changes made to a reminder or list are displayed.  


`CreateReminderList`  
This activity allows the user to create a new reminder list or modify an existing one. Fields for the reminder list name and group will be empty if the user is creating a new list; these fields will be autofilled with previous inputs if the user is editing an existing list.  
**Entrance Criteria**: `ShowReminderLists` -> `CreateReminderList`. If the user is creating a new list, no inputs are necessary. If the user is editing a list, prior inputs for each field are needed, and the list has to have been selected from the previous screen.  
**Exit Criteria**: The user will have created a new list and will be taken back to the `ShowReminderLists` screen, where the new list will be displayed.  


`RemoveReminderList`  
This screen will confirm that the user intends to remove all reminders in the reminder list(s) selected and will delete them if so. If the user wishes to keep the reminders but remove the list, then the reminders will be placed into a default list and the user can reorganize the reminders after returning to that screen. Deleted lists (and reminders) will be removed from the `ShowReminderLists` screen.  
**Entrance Criteria**: `ShowReminderLists` -> `RemoveReminderList`. The user has to have checked off the reminder list(s) to be removed.  
**Exit Criteria**: The user will have deleted a list (and possibly all reminders in the list along with their alerts), and will be taken back to the `ShowReminderLists` screen, where the list will no longer be displayed.  


`CreateReminder`  
This activity allows the user to create a new reminder or modify an existing one. Fields for the reminder name, type, and location will be empty if the user is creating a new reminder; these fields will be autofilled with previous inputs if the user is editing an existing reminder. If creating a new reminder, the user will be taken to the `CreateAlert` screen to set up an alert for the reminder.  
**Entrance Criteria**: `ShowReminderLists` -> `CreateReminder`. If the user is creating a new reminder, no inputs are necessary. If the user is editing a reminder, prior inputs for each field are needed, and the reminder has to have been selected from the previous screen.  
**Exit Criteria**: The user will have created a new reminder and will be taken to the `CreateAlert` screen, where the user can set up an alert for a new reminder, or edit an alert for an existing reminder.  


`RemoveReminder`  
This activity will confirm that the user intends to remove the reminders selected and will delete them if so. Deleted reminders will be removed from their list on the `ShowReminderLists` screen, and their alerts will be deleted as well.  
**Entrance Criteria**: `ShowReminderLists` -> `RemoveReminderList`. The user has to have checked off the reminder(s) to be removed.  
**Exit Criteria**: The user will have deleted the reminder(s) and will be taken back to the `ShowReminderLists` screen, where the reminder will no longer be displayed in any reminder list.  


`CreateAlert`  
This activity allows the user to set up an alert for a new reminder or edit an alert for an existing reminder. The user can enter values for the date and time fields, as well as for the optional location field. The user can also specify if the alert should be repeated; if not, the alert will only be a one-time alert. If the user is creating a new alert, these fields will be empty. If the user is editing an existing alert, these fields will all be autofilled with previous inputs.  
**Entrance Criteria**: `CreateReminder` -> `CreateAlert`. If the user is creating a new alert, no inputs are necessary. If the user is editing an alert, previous inputs for each field are needed.  
**Exit Criteria**: The user has specified a valid date and time (location is optional) to set up or edit an alert so that the alert is successfully created or modified. The user will be taken to the `ShowReminderLists` screen, where the new reminder (or the edited reminder's changes) will be displayed.
