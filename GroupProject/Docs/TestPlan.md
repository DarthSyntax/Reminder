# Test Plan

*This is the template for your test plan. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.*

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

*This section should provide details about your unit-, integration-, system-, and regression-testing strategies. In particular, it should discuss which activities you will perform as part of your testing process, and who will perform such activities.*

### 1.2 Test Selection

*Here you should discuss how you are going to select your test cases, that is, which black-box and/or white-box techniques you will use. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

*Set of commitments that to check every one of the tests are passed.* 

*Unit testing: test edit/delete/add/search and get the test reports after execution.*  

*Statement inclusion: executing statements at least once by giving documentation that to know the outcome is passed or failed.*  

*Framework testing: edit an added reminder, delete the added reminder, search the added reminder, check off the added reminder, clear check of the added reminder.*   

*Decision coverage: executing every choice has a true or false result at east once that every announcement is executed in any event once.*  

*Path coverage: all control stream paths are executed at least once. It counts the number of full paths from contribution to yield.*

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

*Unit testing: Unit Tests will verify an atomic unit of source code, such as a method or a class. It returns expected results.*   

*Integrated testing: In this case we will implement UI Instrumentation tests, such as edit, delete, etc.*  

*System testing: In order to meet all requirements that a user wants; here we tested the system as a whole and the interaction between the components, software and hardware is checked.*

### 1.5 Technology

*JUnit(API)  
or: Library Architecture testing framework;  
Data driven testng framework;  
Module based testing framework;  
Keyword driven testing framework;*

## 2 Test Cases

*This section should be the core of this document. You should provide a table of test cases, one per row. For each test case, the table should provide its purpose, the steps necessary to perform the test, the expected result, the actual result (to be filled later), pass/fail information (to be filled later), and any additional information you think is relevant.*
