Upon opening the application, users are prompted to enter a username and a password to login.  
The following screen displays the user's reminder lists. Users create a list by entering a name for the list and pressing the `Add List` button, and users can add reminders to each list from there.  
To add a reminder, the user must enter a name, specify the type of reminder, and enter a date and a time to be alerted. This information is displayed for each reminder on the Reminder Lists screen.  
Users can add new reminders, edit the information of a reminder, or delete the reminder entirely. Users can also add new reminder lists, edit the name of existing lists, or delete an entire reminder list (and all reminders that fall under that list).
Reminder lists can be expanded to show all the reminders that fall under any given list and the lists can also be collapsed to show only the name of the reminder list.
